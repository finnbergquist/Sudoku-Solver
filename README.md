# Sudoku Solver

It also prints the number of backtracks used, which generally denotes the difficulty of the puzzle.

- **Optional Solution Verification**: Optionally reads a solution from another file and verifies the solved puzzle against it.
- **Solve Puzzle**: Solves the Sudoku puzzle.
- **Print Backtracks**: Prints the number of backtracks used during the solving process.
